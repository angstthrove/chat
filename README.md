# Encrypted Communication Blockchain Project

This project is an open-source blockchain encrypted communication application that uses blockchain technology and encryption algorithms to ensure communication security and privacy between users. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, decentralized, and trusted means of communication, allowing users to communicate information securely.

## Features

- Decentralized: The application does not rely on any centralized servers, and all communication data is stored on a distributed blockchain, meaning that users' communication data cannot be controlled or monitored by third parties.
- Anonymity: Users can choose to use anonymous identities for communication, protecting their personal privacy.
- Security: The application uses high-strength encryption algorithms to encrypt users' communication data, ensuring that users' data cannot be maliciously tampered with or stolen.
- Openness: The application is open source, allowing anyone to view and modify the source code to ensure system security and reliability.

## Tech Stack

- Blockchain technology: Use blockchain technology to store users' communication data, ensuring data reliability and security.
- Encryption algorithms: Use high-strength encryption algorithms to protect users' communication data.
- P2P network: Use a P2P network to implement communication between users, achieving decentralization.
- Go: Use Go as the backend server.
